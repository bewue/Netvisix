# Netvisix
Netvisix listens on your local network interface and visualizes the network packet flow between hosts.
Also packet statistics per host are available.  

This project started in 2014 and was initially hosted on bitbucket.  
Feature requests and bug reports are welcome.

Netvisix is using the following libraries:  
- libtins   
- libpcap/WinPcap (used by libtins)   
- Qt5
